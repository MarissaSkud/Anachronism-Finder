Wordsworth is a tool to help historical fiction authors avoid linguistic anachronisms. You can compare a passage from your story to a corpus of fiction from the decade you're writing about, or look up whether a specific bigram (two-word phrase) is found in fiction from that decade.

        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="toggle-inner">
        <p>Corpus novels should have been written in English between the years of 1800 and 1923, and have had a realistic, contemporary setting at the time they were published. (But we define "realistic" and "contemporary" in a loose way.) For instance, the novels of Austen, Gaskell, Forster, Wharton, Alcott, Trollope, etc.</p>

        <p>None of these novels qualify because they were originally written in French, Russian, and German, respectively. Also, you should take a hard look at why you are so into novels where women commit adultery and then die in misery.</p>

        <span class="title-name">If your corpus is focused on realistic fiction, why does it include <i>Dracula</i> and Sherlock Holmes stories?</span>
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="toggle-inner">
        <p>We have decided to include genre fiction that takes place in a "realistic" setting (as opposed to a fantasy or historical setting). <i>Dracula</i> may be a fantasy/horror novel and the Sherlock Holmes stories may be mystery fiction, but they are recognizably set in 1890s England and offer a wealth of incidental information about how language was used in that decade. They have also proved extremely influential to modern fiction writers. We want Wordsworth to be useful to writers of steampunk stories or mystery stories or gothic stories -- not just writers of "literary" fiction. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="toggle-inner">
        <p><i>Ben-Hur</i> is a work of historical fiction that takes place in a Biblical setting. Therefore, we worried that its language would skew our corpus results in a way that wouldn't be helpful to someone who's using our app to help them write a story that is <i>set</i> in the 1880s. This is also why we have not included the historical novels of Walter Scott.</p>

        <p>As of 2019, the public domain in the United States ends in 1923. For legal reasons, we have therefore decided not to analyze and store word-frequency data from novels written in 1924 and later. As new 1920s novels enter the public domain in the years to come, we will try to add them to our corpus. If you feel strongly that the U.S. public domain laws are ridiculous, lobby your Congressional representatives.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="toggle-inner">
        <p>It allows you to tell the system to ignore certain words in your passage (words you may already know are anachronistic) before analyzing it. For instance, Mary Robinette Kowal's fantasy novel <i>Shades of Milk and Honey</i> is heavily influenced by the works of Jane Austen, but it features a hero named "Mr. Vincent" and a magic system known as "glamour". Neither the words "vincent" or "glamour" appear in our 1810s corpus, so it would make sense for Kowal to tell the system to ignore those words if she ran her text through the app.</p>
